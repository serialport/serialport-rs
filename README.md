# Introduction

`serialport-rs` is a general-purpose cross-platform serial port library for Rust. It provides a
blocking I/O interface and port enumeration on POSIX and Windows systems.

For async I/O functionality, see the [mio-serial](https://github.com/berkowski/mio-serial) and
[tokio-serial](https://github.com/berkowski/tokio-serial) crates.

**This project is looking for maintainers! Especially for Windows. If you are interested please let
us know on Matrix, or by [creating a

# Overview

The library exposes cross-platform serial port functionality through the `SerialPort` trait. This
library is structured to make this the simplest API to use to encourage cross-platform development
by default. Working with the resultant `Box<dyn SerialPort>` type is therefore recommended. To
expose additional platform-specific functionality use the platform-specific structs directly:
`TTYPort` for POSIX systems and `COMPort` for Windows.

Serial enumeration is provided on most platforms. The implementation on Linux using `glibc` relies
on `libudev` (unless you disable the default `libudev` feature), an external dynamic library that
will need to be available on the system the final binary is running on. Enumeration will still be
available if this feature is disabled, but won't expose as much information and may return ports
that don't exist physically. However this dependency can be removed by disabling the default
`libudev` feature:

```shell
$ cargo build --no-default-features
```

It should also be noted that on macOS, both the Callout (`/dev/cu.*`) and Dial-in ports
(`/dev/tty.*`) ports are enumerated, resulting in two available ports per connected serial device.

# Usage

Listing available ports:

```rust
let ports = serialport::available_ports().expect("No ports found!");
for p in ports {
    println!("{}", p.port_name);
}

```

Opening and configuring a port:

```rust
let port = serialport::new("/dev/ttyUSB0", 115_200)
    .timeout(Duration::from_millis(10))
    .open().expect("Failed to open port");
```

Writing to a port:

```rust
let output = "This is a test. This is only a test.".as_bytes();
port.write(output).expect("Write failed!");
```

Reading from a port (default is blocking with a 0ms timeout):

```rust
let mut serial_buf: Vec<u8> = vec![0; 32];
port.read(serial_buf.as_mut_slice()).expect("Found no data!");
```

Some platforms expose additional functionality, which is opened using the `open_native()` method:

```rust
let port = serialport::new("/dev/ttyUSB0", 115_200)
    .open_native().expect("Failed to open port");
```

Closing a port:

`serialport-rs` uses the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) paradigm and so closing a
port is done when the `SerialPort` object is `Drop`ed either implicitly or explicitly using
`std::mem::drop` (`std::mem::drop(port)`).

# Examples

There are several included examples, which help demonstrate the functionality of this library and
can help debug software or hardware errors.

- _clear_input_buffer_ - Demonstrates querying and clearing the driver input buffer.
- _clear_output_buffer_ - Demonstrates querying and clearing the driver output buffer.
- _duplex_ - Tests that a port can be successfully cloned.
- _hardware_check_ - Checks port/driver functionality for a single port or a pair of ports connected
  to each other.
- _list_ports_ - Lists available serial ports.
- _pseudo_terminal_ - Unix only. Tests that a pseudo-terminal pair can be created.
- _receive_data_ - Output data received on a port.
- _transmit_ - Transmits data regularly on a port with various port configurations. Useful for
  debugging.

# Dependencies

Rust versions 1.59.0 and higher are supported by the library itself. There are
examples requiring newer versions of Rust.

For GNU/Linux `pkg-config` headers are required:

- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install pkg-config`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install pkgconf-pkg-config`

For other distros they may provide `pkg-config` through the `pkgconf` package instead.

For GNU/Linux `libudev` headers are required as well (unless you disable the default `libudev`
feature):

- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libudev-dev`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install systemd-devel`

# Platform Support

Builds and some tests (not requiring actual hardware) for major targets are run
in CI. Failures of either block the inclusion of new code. This library should
be compatible with additional targets not listed below, but no guarantees are
made. Additional platforms may be added in the future if there is a need and/or
demand.

- Android
  - `arm-linux-androideabi` (no serial enumeration)
  - `armv7-linux-androideabi` (no serial enumeration)
- FreeBSD
  - `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`
- Linux
  - `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
  - `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
  - `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`
  - `i686-unknown-linux-musl`
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- macOS/iOS
  - `aarch64-apple-darwin`
  - `aarch64-apple-ios`
  - `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- NetBSD
  - `x86_64-unknown-netbsd` (no serial enumeration)
- Windows
  - `i686-pc-windows-gnu`
  - `i686-pc-windows-msvc`
  - `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
  - `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

# Hardware Support

This library has been developed to support all serial port devices across all supported platforms.
To determine how well your platform is supported, please run the `hardware_check` example provided
with this library. It will test the driver to confirm that all possible settings are supported for a
port. Additionally, it will test that data transmission is correct for those settings if you have
two ports physically configured to communicate. If you experience problems with your devices, please
file a bug and identify the hardware, OS, and driver in use.

Known issues:

| Hardware      | OS    | Driver                  | Issues                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FTDI TTL-232R | Linux | ftdi_sio, Linux 4.14.11 | Hardware doesn't support 5 or 6 data bits, but the driver lies about supporting 5. |
