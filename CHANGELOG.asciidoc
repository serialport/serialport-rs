=== [UNRELEASED]
==== Added

==== Changed

==== Fixed
* Upgraded `sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu` to Tier 2 support

==== Removed

=== [3.2.0] - 2019-01-01
==== Added
* Port enumeration is now supported on FreeBSD.

==== Changed
* Minimum supported Rust version changed to 1.24.1

==== Fixed
* Fixed software flow control for POSIX systems ([!54](https://gitlab.com/susurrus/serialport-rs/merge_requests/54))

==== Removed
* Removed support for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnux32`.

=== [3.1.0] - 2018-11-02
==== Added
* Added `bytes_to_read()`, `bytes_to_write()`, and `clear()` to `SerialPort`.
  Also added example scripts for using them.
* Added Tier 2 support for:
  * `armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi`
* Added "libudev" feature to allow for disabling linking to `libudev` on Linux.

=== [3.0.0] - 2018-07-14
==== Added
* Arbitrary baud rates are now supported on BSDs, Linux, and Windows.
* Added Tier 1 support for `{i586|i686|x86_64}-unknown-linux-musl`
* Added Tier 2 support for:
  * `{arm|armv7}-linux-androideabi`
  * `i686-linux-android`
  * `{i686|x86_64}-unknown-freebsd`
  * `arm-unknown-linux-musleabi`
  * `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`
  * `{mips64|mips64el}-unknown-linux-gnuabi64`
  * `armv5te-unknown-linux-gnueabi`
  * `{aarch64|mips|mipsel|powerpc64|powerpc64le|powerpc|s390x}-unknown-linux-gnu`
  * `{mips|mipsel}-unknown-linux-musl`
  * `x86_64-unknown-netbsd`
* Added Tier 3 support for:
  * `{aarch64|x86_64}-linux-android`
  * `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`
  * `sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
  * `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnux32`

==== Changed
* Most port configuration methods now return a `Result<()>`.
* Renamed `SerialPort::port_name()` to `name()`.

==== Fixed
* On Windows, the `port_name` field on `SerialPortInfo` included an extraneous trailing nul byte
  character.

==== Removed
* The `BaudRate` enum was removed in favor of a `u32`.

=== [2.3.0] - 2018-03-13
==== Added
* Added `examples/hardware_check.rs` for use in debugging library or
  driver issues when using physical serial ports.
* Added `SerialPort::try_clone` which allows for cloning a port for full-duplex
  reading and writing.

==== Changed
* Removed configuration caching for serial ports. The underlying implementations
  for all platforms cached a configuration struct so that modifying the port
  settings involved a single switch into kernel space. This has been removed so
  now two system calls are needed for every configuration change. This is
  probably a slight performance regression, but should allow the new
  `SerialPort::try_clone` interface to work as people expect.

==== Fixed
* `TTYPort::into_raw_fd` will now work as expected. It previously closed
  the port so the returned file descriptor would be invalid.
* 921600 baud is now supported on NetBSD and FreeBSD.

=== [2.2.0] - 2018-03-13
Unreleased, happened due to a user error using `cargo-release`

=== [2.1.0] - 2018-02-14
==== Added
* `impl FromRawHandle` for `COMPort`

==== Changed
* Specific IO-related errors are now returned instead of mapping every IO
  error to Unknown. This makes it possible to catch things like time-out
  errors.
* Changed all baud rates to be reported as the discrete `BaudRate::Baud*` types
  rather than as the `BaudRate::BaudOther(*)` type.

==== Fixed
* Modem-type USB serial devices are now enumerated on OS X. This now allows
  connected Arduinos to be detected.
* Compilation on FreeBSD and NetBSD was fixed by removing the 921600 baud rates.
  These will be re-added in a future release.

=== [2.0.0] - 2017-12-18
==== Added
* USB device information is now returned in calls to `available_ports()`
* Serial port enumeration is now supported on Mac
* Serial port enumeration now attempts to return the interface used for the
  port (USB, PCI, Bluetooth, Unknown).
* `BaudRate::standard_rates()` provides a vector of cross-platform baud rates.
* `SerialPort` trait is now `Send`

==== Changed
* Software license has changed from LGPLv3+ to MPL-2.0. This makes it
  possible to use this library in any Rust project if it's unmodified.
* Mac is now a Tier 2 supported platform
* Removed `BaudRate::from_speed(usize)` and `BaudRate::speed -> usize` in favor
  of the `From<u32>` and `Into<u32>` traits.
* Removed `available_baud_rates` in favor of `BaudRate::platform_rates()` as
  this has a more clear semantic meaning. The returned list of baud rates is
  now also correct for all supported platforms.
* Removed `termios` dependency in favor of `nix`. This is a big step towards
  supporting additional platforms.

==== Fixed
* Stop bits are now specified properly (had been reversed). Thanks to
  @serviushack (MR#9)
* `TTYPort::pair()` is now thread-safe.
* `TTYPort::open()` no longer leaks file descriptors if it errors. Thanks to
  @daniel (MR#12)
* Fixed compilation when targeting Android

=== [1.0.1] - 2017-02-20
==== Fixed
* `read()` now properly blocks for at least one character
* Compilation now works on Mac

=== [1.0.0] - 2017-02-13
==== Changed
* Various documentation/README updates
* Minor formatting fixes (from rustfmt)

==== Fixed
* Platform-specific examples are now only built on appropriate platforms

=== [0.9.0] - 2017-02-09
==== Added
* `impl Debug` for `COMPort`
* `exclusive()` and `set_exclusive()` for `TTYPort`
* `port_name()` for `SerialPort`
* `impl FromRawFd` and `impl IntoRawFd` for `TTYPort`
* `pair()` for `TTYPort`

=== [0.3.0] - 2017-01-28
==== Added
* `open_with_settings()` to support initializing the port with custom settings
* `SerialPortSettings` is now publically usable being exported in the prelude,
  having all public and commented fields, and a `Default` impl.

==== Changed
* `TTYPort/COMPort::open()` now take a `SerialPortSettings` argument and return
  concrete types
* `serialport::open()` now initializes the port to reasonable defaults
* Removed all instances of `try!()` for `?`
* `SerialPort::set_all()` now borrows `SerialPortSettings`

=== [0.2.4] - 2017-01-26
==== Added
* Report an Unimplemented error for unsupported unix targets

==== Changed
* Minor changes suggested by Clippy
* Reworked Cargo.toml to more easily support additional targets

==== Fixed
* AppVeyor badge should now be properly displayed

=== [0.2.3] - 2017-01-21
==== Added
* Specify AppVeyor build status badge for crates.io

=== [0.2.2] - 2017-01-21
* No changes, purely a version increment to push new crate metadata to crates.io

=== [0.2.1] - 2017-01-21
==== Added
* Specify category for crates.io

=== [0.2.0] - 2017-01-07
